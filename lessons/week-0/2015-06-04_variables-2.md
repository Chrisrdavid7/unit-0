#### Exercise #1: Your Schedule

Use several variables to store the names of your classes and their teachers. Then, display a nice little table displaying your schedule.  Just FYI, my column of courses has a width of 26 characters, and the teacher column has a width of 15. The first and last lines are a plus sign, fifty dashes (a.k.a. minus signs) and another plus sign.

Your table doesn't need to look exactly like this, or even line up. I used a total of sixteen variables (course1, course2, ... course8, teacher1, teacher2, etc.). You should do the same.

#### Exercise #2: 12 Days of Christmas
Print "The Twelve Days of Christmas", an English carol with a lot of repetition!
You can find the structure of the lyrics here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_%28song%29#Lyrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_%28song%29#Lyrics).
Use variables to store bits of repeated data and print the full lyrics.
